# simple-email-sender
A simple script on Spring Boot that performs the function of sending emails.<br>
I took it to a small service and use it in my projects if I need a mail service.<br>
The script can be expanded if additional functionality is needed.<br>
The code shows the minimum required for working mailing.

To test the service, replace the data in the file application.properties<br> (you will need to create an application password, if you use a Gmail mailbox, you can get information on how to do this [here](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en)) <br><br>
And also change the data in the code section below to yours
<div align="left">
  <img src= "test.png"
      alt = "drawing"
    width = "75%">
</div>
